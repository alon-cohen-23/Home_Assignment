# Home AssignmentWelcome to my home assignment! This repository contains my implementation of **Stage 1** and **Stage 2** of the task. You can run the system by executing:### 1. Clone the repositoryFirst, clone the repo to your local machine: ```bash    git clone https://github.com/alon-cohen-23/FinTrack.git ``` ### 2. Install the dependenciesNavigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using pip:  ```bash    cd Home_Assignment    pip install -r requirements.txt  ``` ### 3. Run main.pyrun the main file```bash   python main.py```   # Stage 1Each component lives in its own file.Detailed documentation (docstrings and comments) explains the logic in each module.# Planned Enhancements (not yet implemented)* Logger– Capture and save all runtime messages to help trace the end-to-end process.– (Currently printing to console.)* config.yaml– Centralize all system settings in one configuration file.* Async Processing with Priority Queue– Speed up frame extraction and motion-detection by processing in parallel.* Video Timeline Fix– Adjust the timeline overlay on the video.– (Discovered too late in development — easily fixable.)# Stage 2Successfully added a blur effect to detected regions in the display window. # Stage 3The video window does not close properly on my computer (neither manually nor automatically).and i haven't had time to resolve this, but the fix should be straightforward.
